HTML Structure
HTML Layout:

The HTML layout is structured into three main sections: header, main, and footer, along with modal dialogs for 
login and signup, and a notification area.
Header: Contains a logo and a consistent styling with a shadow and semi-transparent background for visibility 
against varying backgrounds.
Main: Centers the content vertically and horizontally with buttons to open login and signup modals.
Footer: Provides a consistent footer with a copyright notice.

Modals:

Login and Signup Modals: Both modals are implemented with similar structures but different forms. 
They are initially hidden using the hidden class and displayed using JavaScript.
Design: Modals are centered using flex utilities and have a semi-transparent background for focus. 
The relative positioning of modal content allows for absolutely positioned close buttons.

Notification:

A notification area at the top-right corner is used to provide feedback to users about the success or failure
of their actions (login/signup).

CSS (Tailwind CSS and Custom Styles)
Tailwind CSS:

Utility-first Approach: Tailwind CSS is used for utility classes that handle layout, spacing, typography, and colors. 
This approach ensures a responsive design without writing extensive custom CSS.
Responsiveness: Tailwind's responsive utilities adjust modal padding and content width for smaller screens.

Custom Styles:

Font and Color Customization: Custom styles are used to integrate a specific font (Grey Qo) and handle specific UI elements 
like error icons.
Modals: Custom CSS transitions handle the visibility and opacity of modals. This improves user experience by providing 
smooth animations when showing or hiding modals.
Error Handling: Custom styles for error icons and messages improve clarity by ensuring that errors are clearly visible
 and aesthetically integrated with the form design.

JavaScript Functionality

Modal Handling:

Show/Hide Logic: Functions showModal and hideModal manage the visibility of modals. The hidden class is used to control 
the display, and resetForm clears form data and errors when closing a modal.
Event Listeners: Buttons for opening and closing modals use event listeners to toggle visibility.

Password Visibility Toggle:

Toggle Function: togglePasswordVisibility allows users to switch between password visibility and hiding. This is a common
feature in login/signup forms to enhance usability.

Form Validation:

Validation Functions: Functions like validateName, validateEmail, etc., ensure that user input meets specific criteria
(e.g., valid email format, minimum password length).
Error Display: showError and hideError functions manage the display of error messages and icons based on validation results.

Notification Handling:

Notify Function: notify displays success or error messages with appropriate styles and hides them after a set duration.
This provides instant feedback to users.

Form Submission:

Signup Form: On form submission, validation functions are called. If all fields are valid, user data is saved to localStorage,
and a success notification is shown.
Login Form: Validates user credentials against stored data. If credentials match, a success notification is shown, and the user
is redirected.

Dynamic Button Enabling:

Signup Button: toggleSignupButton dynamically enables or disables the signup button based on form validation. This prevents form 
submission if validation fails.

Summary
The design emphasizes a clean and user-friendly interface with modals for user authentication, responsive design for various 
screen sizes, and real-time validation for input fields. Tailwind CSS is used for rapid development and consistency, while custom 
styles and JavaScript handle specific functional and aesthetic requirements. The approach ensures a modern, intuitive user 
experience with clear feedback and validation mechanisms.
